# Free Trial Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete free trial system for the "Start Your Free Trial Today" button with usage limitations and upgrade prompts.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Free Trial Button Logic
- **Location**: `index.html` - CTA section
- **Function**: `startFreeTrial()` - Replaces payment flow with free trial signup
- **Behavior**: 
  - Sets `isFreeTrial` flag in localStorage
  - Opens signup modal with "Start Your Free Trial" title
  - Skips checkout process entirely

### 2. User Registration for Free Trial
- **Location**: `index.html` - Auth form handler
- **Changes**:
  - Creates users with `subscription_status: 'free_trial'`
  - Sets `plan_type: 'starter'` for trial users
  - Redirects directly to dashboard (no payment required)
  - Shows welcome message: "Welcome! Your free trial has started."

### 3. Usage Limitation System
- **Location**: `app.js` - `StartupStackAI` class
- **Method**: `checkUsageLimits(userId, operation)`
- **Logic**:
  - Checks if user has `subscription_status: 'free_trial'`
  - Counts today's operations for specific AI tool
  - Blocks operation if limit exceeded (1 use per tool per day)
  - Uses existing `operation_history` table for tracking

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling & Upgrade Prompts
- **Location**: `dashboard.html` - AI tool form handlers
- **When Limit Exceeded**:
  - Shows custom upgrade modal instead of generic error
  - Displays lock icon and clear messaging
  - Provides "Upgrade to Pro" button linking to pricing
  - Includes "Come back tomorrow" message for free option

### 5. Visual Indicators for Free Trial Users
- **Dashboard Badge**: "Free Trial - 1 use per tool per day"
- **Upgrade Banner**: Prominent orange banner with usage limits explanation
- **Plan Detection**: Dashboard recognizes and handles `free_trial` status

### 6. Upgrade Flow Integration
- **Upgrade URLs**: `/?upgrade=true` automatically scrolls to pricing
- **Multiple Entry Points**: 
  - Dashboard banner
  - Limit-reached modal
  - Free trial badge area

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Requirements
```sql
-- Users table should support:
subscription_status: 'free_trial' | 'pending' | 'active' | 'lifetime_active'
plan_type: 'starter' | 'basic' | 'pro' | 'lifetime'

-- operation_history table (already exists):
user_id, operation_type, created_at (for daily usage tracking)
```

### Usage Limit Logic
```javascript
// Per tool per day limit check
const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
const operations = await supabase
    .from('operation_history')
    .select('id, operation_type')
    .eq('user_id', userId)
    .eq('operation_type', operation) // Specific AI tool
    .gte('created_at', today + 'T00:00:00.000Z')
    .lt('created_at', today + 'T23:59:59.999Z');

if (operations.length >= 1) {
    throw new Error('Free trial limit reached...');
}
```

### Error Handling Flow
1. **Usage Check**: Before each AI operation
2. **Limit Exceeded**: Throws specific error message
3. **UI Response**: Shows upgrade modal with clear call-to-action
4. **Operation Blocked**: AI call never reaches the API when limit exceeded

## User Experience Flow

### New Free Trial User
1. Clicks "Start Your Free Trial Today"
2. Sees "Start Your Free Trial" signup modal
3. Creates account → Redirected to dashboard
4. Sees free trial banner and badge
5. Can use each AI tool once per day

### When Limit is Reached
1. User tries to use AI tool second time today
2. Operation is blocked before API call
3. Custom modal appears with upgrade options
4. Clear messaging about daily limits
5. Prominent upgrade button to pricing page

### Upgrade Path
1. Multiple upgrade entry points throughout dashboard
2. Upgrade links redirect to pricing section
3. Clear value proposition for unlimited usage
